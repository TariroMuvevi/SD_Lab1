                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My full name is Tariro Aquilina Olorato Muvevi, quite the mouthful right. 
                    I was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa but I aslo have roots in Zimbabwe through my Father.
                    Currently, I am studying towards a BSc in Computer Science at Wits. I've always enjoyed using technology to create, whether it's a program, a game or design a aesthetic poster; the possibilities are endless.
                    However, I do regocnise the great priviledge I have of even just being able to explore these possibilities, and I hope to use my talents to bridge the gap tech acn bring and empower others with it.

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>Currently I am working on a managing sytem for a small student accomadation, Musha Lofts. 
                    It is still in the early stages of developement, but the main focus will be to create ease of access and management of the day to day  and room allocation.
